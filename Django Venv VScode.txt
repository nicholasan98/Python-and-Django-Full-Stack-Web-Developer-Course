Using python's built in virtual environment system ('venv'), navigate to the directory in terminal:
python -m venv myDjangoEnv


To activate the virtual environment:
myDjangoEnv\Scripts\activate

To deactivate the venv:
deactivate


Starting a django project:
django-admin startproject project_name

After project, make an app:
python manage.py startapp app_name


In the venv, to run a server:
python manage.py runserver


Creating a model after making them in models.py:
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations app_name
python manage.py migrate
(models should not be ready to connect to sql database that python has made for us)
